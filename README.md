A project that is able to parse *.stp files (ISO 10303 STEP) in order to generate Opitz Code. STEP-files are engineering part models represented by 3D geometry and topology, generated by any CAD-environment that supports *.stp conversion. Opitz Code - a shape classification system enabling grouping by particular product features (bores, grooves, rotational/non, etc). Implemented project analyses STEP-file and extracts product features for further generation of Opitz Code.
